# mig-e2e
End to end tests for OCP 3 to 4 Migration

## Pre-requisites

* OCP3 v3.7 (or higher) and OCP4 clusters, these would be the _source_ and _destination_ clusters used to migrate workloads
* [mig-controller](https://github.com/fusor/mig-controller) must be deployed on _one of the two_ clusters
* Velero must be deployed on both clusters and will be driven by mig-controller (see instructions [here](https://github.com/fusor/mig-controller#quick-start))
* S3 temporary migration storage must be provisioned on AWS for mig-controller to consume
* NFS or other compatible volume storage must be provisioned on both clusters for PVC based test

## Mig-controller config variables

A number of parameters need to be set with the correct environment in order to create the CRs for migration purposes. A [sample](https://github.com/fusor/mig-e2e/config/mig_controller.yml.example) file is supplied, **please make changes as necessary**.

See below for a decription of these paremeters :

| Parameter | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `mig_controller_remote_cluster_url` | Endpoint of remote cluster mig-controller will connect to |
| `mig_controller_aws_access_key` | Base64 encoded AWS access key to auth with AWS services |
| `mig_controller_aws_secret_key` | Base64 encoded AWS secret access key to auth with AWS services |
| `mig_controller_sa_token` | Base64 encoded SA token used to authenticate with remote cluster |
| `mig_controller_aws_bucket_name` | Name of the S3 bucket to be used for temporary Migration storage |
| `mig_controller_aws_bucket_region` | Region of S3 bucket to be used for temporary Migration storage |

## Other considerations

* You must active sessions on the source and destination clusters before attempting to run any tests
* By default, the destination cluster (OCP4) is assumed to be the host for mig-controller
* Stateful applications tests such as nfs-pv require PVs to allocated on source and destination clusters

## Running mig-controller sample tests

On the **source** cluster, deploy **all** sample tests

```bash
$ ansible-playbook e2e_mig_samples.yml -e "with_migrate=false"
```

On the **destination** cluster (mig-controller host) , migrate **all** sample tests

```bash
$ ansible-playbook e2e_mig_samples.yml -e "with_deploy=false"
```

Alternatively you can deploy (or migrate) a single or multiple sample tests by using tags

```bash
ansible-playbook e2e_mig_samples.yml --tags=sock-shop -e "with_migrate=false"
ansible-playbook e2e_mig_samples.yml --tags=sock-shop,parks-app -e "with_deploy=false"
```

The migrations will be tracked to completion, you can also check the status of each _phase of the migration_ using : 

```bash
$ oc -n mig describe migmigration nginx-mig-1560432273
